# Luigi Daemon using Docker image
- https://hub.docker.com/r/axiom/docker-luigi/

# Further integrations

## This example does the following:
1. Single output - single input
2. NormaliseDataT normalises data from input and writes output as CSV

## Notes
- bind mounts mean that if I change the file that it is mounted to, the Docker container automatically picks up the changes
